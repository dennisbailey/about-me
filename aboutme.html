  <h2 class="more-about-h2">What Sticks With Me</h2>
  
  <p class="more-about-body">
    I read this years ago and I think about it often.
    
    <blockquote> 
      To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded. 
    </blockquote>
  
    It's often attributed to Ralph Waldo Emmerson, but nobody really knows who wrote it.
